		<p>It was a daunting task to create a header, navbar, footer, and sidebar because

		<p>Hi my name is Sammy, I was born at UCSC about a week ago on 1/30/2018. I enjoy eating leaves and crawling on
		the ground.</p>
		<p>If you ever want to talk to me, here's my LinkedIn: <a href="linkedin.com/in/sammayy">linkedin.com/in/sammayy</a></p>
		<p>I started eating leaves and crawling when I realized that's what I was supposed to do. I actually do this every single day.</p>
		<p>I will definitely keep doing this in the future for my own survival. Also, I enjoy eating leaves and crawling on the ground, so I'll do that because I like to do it</p>
		<p>Some classes I'll be taking:</p>
		<li>Winter 2018: CMPS 183: Web Apps, from the computer science department</li>
		<li>Winter 2018: ART 1: Intro to Art, from the art department</li>
		<li>Spring 2018: ART 2: Exploring Art, from the art department</li>
		<li>Spring 2018: ART 3: Art in Depth, from the art department</li>
